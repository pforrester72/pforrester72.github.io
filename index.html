        <p>Like most psycholinguists, I am interested in the relationship between language and thought. I approach this by studying how children learn logical terms. I currently focus on how children learn truth-functional negation by investigating what cues are available to them as they grow. I also work on words that convey a symmetrical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entailment">entailment relationship</a> between their constituents (if X is Y's cousin, then Y is X's cousin too, necessarily).

        <h3 id="negation">Negation</h3>
        <p>How do we learn what <i>not</i> means? It's difficult to point to in the world, yet children say it all the time. <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/lois-bloom">Lois Bloom</a> suggested that there's actually a few kinds of negation: prohibition ("No running!"), nonexistence ("No more water"), and denial ("That's not a dog") among others. Past and current research found that children produce and comprehend denial later than other kinds of negation<label for="sn-alex-roman" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="sn-alex-roman" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>Though, the comprehension side is still debated, see work by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15475441.2017.1317253?casa_token=txzPqZZLPg8AAAAA:_vq4S8WXRDXDODtH0MdXOkAWbZFaXy6qszbhcf5ZQvT3vvGcNYyeBuWOYED1P-j2L8XJ_iHLtOlR">Feiman</a> and de Carvalho, A., Gomes, V., Chen, Y., & Trueswell, J. (in prep).</em></span>. This apparent delay may be because they lack the conceptual machinery to represent it. Or, it may be beause denial contains fewer perceptual cues, and as a result requires integrating  perceptual and linguistic information. In other words, I am interested in whether negation as a concept must be acquired. If so, then how is it learned and what changes throughout development? If not, then how do we map it onto language and why is there a delay? I'm also interested in how negation is processed in real-time, how it affects word-learning, and how it relates to inhibitory control.

        <h3 id="symmetry">Symmetry</h3>
        <p>Many relations and the way they're expressed in language are assymetrical. "João saw Maria," does not necessarily entail that "Maria saw João." But, there are some words that behave differently. For example, if I'm equal to you, then it's necessarily true that you're equal to me. We call these words which strongly entail the inverse ordering "symmetricals."</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A relation R is symmetrical if and only if (iff) for all <em>x,y</em>: if R(<em>x,y</em>), then R(<em>y,x</em>).</p>
          <footer>Gleitman et al. 2019, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/24/11705.full.pdf?casa_token=KerrwK7IqoIAAAAA:wGiqcUwJsx10FQ_gdUS8uVXZdvesTwu0ZmTMihthNEtB1QCBJZg1Sc5Idf86-r1I5g_TgS8jqXaRCw">The emergence of the formal category “symmetry”in a new sign language"</a></footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Symmetricals can be nouns (e.g., <i>cousin</i>, <i>brother</i>), prepositions (e.g., <i>near</i>, <i>by</i>), and adjectives (e.g., <i>similar</i>, <i>equal</i>). Unlike other words, they seem to always require multiple participants (e.g., "João kicks," but "*João meets."). I'm interested in how we learn which words are symmetrical, and what this says about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHNArEfBKdc">structure of language</a>.</p>
